A project based off of boost(a previous project).

It has models of a user and exercise.

Exercise can perfom al basic crud operations.

I will eventually add navigator to the front end and leaflet to track a user and use
the cordinates to populate a map route.

It is a node server.

It uses MongoDB Atlas.

Currently deployed on Heroku but it will be dockerised and deployed on Azure.
