A project based off of boost(a previous project).

It has models of a user and exercise and exercise route.
It communicates with the front end.


Exercise can perfom all basic crud operations.
It takes in several pieces of data and will populate a table on the front end.

Exercise routes has a search function for a specific username and a regex for a name like a certain name. 
Exercise routes takes in an array of arrays to populate a map with points on the frontend. 



One is for a specific username to find all routes associated with that user. 
I have used username as method for communicating between different clusters. 




It is a node server using express.
It uses MongoDB Atlas.

Currently deployed on Heroku and it has been dockerised.
